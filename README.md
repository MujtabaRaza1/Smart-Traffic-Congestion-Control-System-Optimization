# Smart Traffic Congestion Control System

This project implements a machine learning and knowledge-based system for predicting and optimizing traffic congestion in urban environments.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed traffic datasets
- `preprocessing/`: Scripts for data cleaning and feature engineering
- `models/`: ML models for traffic prediction
- `optimization/`: Knowledge representation and optimization algorithms
- `visualization/`: Dashboard and visualization tools
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Instructions for running different components of the system will be added as they are developed.

## Project Goals

- Predict traffic congestion using machine learning
- Represent traffic knowledge and constraints
- Optimize traffic flow using intelligent algorithms
- Visualize traffic patterns and system recommendations
