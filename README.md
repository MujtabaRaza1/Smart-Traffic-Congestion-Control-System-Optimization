# Smart Traffic Congestion Control System Optimization

A machine learning and knowledge representation-based system for predicting and managing traffic congestion in urban areas. The system leverages historical and real-time traffic data to predict congestion patterns and generate traffic optimization recommendations.

## Features

- **Traffic Data Processing**: Process synthetic and real-world traffic data
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict traffic congestion using various ML algorithms
- **Knowledge Representation**: Graph-based road network representation
- **Optimization System**: Generate congestion control recommendations
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize traffic patterns and recommendations
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Professional plots of traffic trends and patterns

## Data Sources

The system can work with different types of traffic data:

1. **Synthetic Traffic Data**: Generated by simulation with realistic traffic patterns including:
   - Daily and weekly traffic cycles
   - Rush hour patterns
   - Road type differences
   - Weather effects on congestion
   - Incident simulation and impact

2. **External Data**: Can be integrated with external datasets like:
   - City traffic sensor data
   - Kaggle traffic datasets
   - GPS navigation data

## Visualizations

The system provides detailed visualizations to help understand traffic patterns:

- **Daily Traffic Patterns**: Hourly congestion levels by road type
- **Weekly Patterns**: Day-of-week traffic variations
- **Rush Hour Analysis**: Comparison of metrics during rush vs. non-rush hours
- **Congestion Heatmaps**: Hour-by-day view of congestion levels
- **Feature Correlation**: Relationships between traffic variables
- **Road Type Comparison**: Analysis of different road types
- **Time Series**: Temporal patterns of congestion, speed, and volume

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx, plotly, dash

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Traffic-Congestion-Control-System-Optimization.git
cd Smart-Traffic-Congestion-Control-System-Optimization

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate data and run the system
python main.py --generate-data

# Run the dashboard
python run_dashboard.py
```

### Using Different Data Sources

```bash
# Switch between data sources
python data_source_switcher.py --source synthetic  # Use synthetic data
python data_source_switcher.py --source kaggle     # Use Kaggle data (if available)

# Generate visualizations
python analysis/traffic_visualizer.py
```

## Dashboard

Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:8051/](http://localhost:8051/) after running `python run_dashboard.py`. The dashboard provides:

- Traffic overview
- Road network visualization 
- Congestion level monitoring
- Traffic optimization recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Traffic data is collected or generated with temporal and spatial attributes
2. **Feature Engineering**: Raw data is processed into features useful for congestion prediction
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models are trained on historical data
4. **Knowledge Graph**: Road network and traffic rules are represented in a knowledge graph
5. **Recommendation Generation**: AI algorithms suggest traffic optimization actions
6. **Visualization**: Results are displayed through an interactive dashboard

## Research Applications

This system addresses the research objectives:

1. **Machine Learning for Traffic Prediction**: Demonstrates how ML techniques can accurately predict traffic congestion patterns
2. **Knowledge Representation for Optimization**: Shows how domain-specific knowledge about traffic can be used for optimization
